# Individual project for Codaisseur's bootcamp.

### This is a RESTful API rendering 30 seeded MLB ballparks in JSON, with relevant info about each ballpark.

Each ballpark is reviewable. An average rating is calculated for each ballpark based on it's reviews, and a list of latest 10 reviews can be requested.
An up to date MLB newsfeed is also rendered in JSON, using nokogiri to get the news.

The Front End is completely built in React.js

As with all bootcamp projects, this is still a work in progress. So if you're interested check back once in a while.
