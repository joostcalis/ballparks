  description: "Yankee Stadium is a stadium, used mainly for baseball, located in The Bronx, New York City. It is the home ballpark for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). The $2.3 billion stadium, built with $1.2 billion in public subsidies, replaced the original Yankee Stadium. It is one block north of the original, on the 24-acre former site of Macombs Dam Park; the 8-acre site of the original stadium is now a public park called Heritage Field. The first game at the new Yankee Stadium was a preseason exhibition game against the Chicago Cubs on April 3, 2009; the Yankees won, 7–4. The first regular-season game was played on April 16, a 10–2 Yankee loss to the Cleveland Indians. The overall price tag makes the new Yankee Stadium the most expensive stadium ever built."

  description: "Fenway Park is a baseball park located in Boston, Massachusetts, at 4 Yawkey Way near Kenmore Square. Since 1912, it has been the home of the Boston Red Sox, the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. It is the oldest ballpark in MLB.
  Because of its age and constrained location in Boston's dense Fenway–Kenmore neighborhood, the park has been renovated or expanded many times, resulting in quirky features including The Triangle, Pesky's Pole, and the Green Monster in left field. It is the fourth smallest among MLB ballparks by seating capacity, second smallest by total capacity, and one of eight that cannot accommodate at least 40,000 spectators."

  The stadium was renamed Rogers Centre following the purchase of the stadium by Rogers Communications, which also bought the Toronto Blue Jays, in 2005. The venue was noted for being the first stadium to have a fully retractable motorized roof, as well as for the 348-room hotel attached to it, with 70 rooms overlooking the field. It is also the last North American major-league stadium built to accommodate both football and baseball. The stadium served as the site of both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2015 Pan American Games. During the ceremonies, the site was referred to as the Pan Am Dome (officially as the Pan Am Ceremonies Venue) instead of its normal name."

The park is owned by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, but operated by the White Sox. The park opened for the 1991 season, after the White Sox had spent 81 years at the original Comiskey Park. The new park, completed at a cost of $167 million, also opened with the Comiskey Park name, but became U.S. Cellular Field in 2003 after U.S. Cellular bought the naming rights at $68 million over 20 years. It hosted the MLB All-Star Game that same year. Many sportscasters and fans continue to use the name Comiskey Park. Prior to its demolition, the old Comiskey Park was the oldest in-use ballpark in Major League Baseball, a title now held by Fenway Park in Boston. The current public address announcer is Gene Honda, who also serves as the PA announcer for the Chicago Blackhawks.
  The stadium is situated just to the west of the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago's Armour Square neighborhood, adjacent to the more famous neighborhood of Bridgeport. It was built directly across 35th Street from old Comiskey Park, which was demolished to make room for a parking lot that serves the venue. Old Comiskey's home plate location is represented by a marble plaque on the sidewalk next to U.S. Cellular Field and the foul lines are painted in the parking lot. Also, the spectator ramp across 35th Street is designed in such a way (partly curved, partly straight but angling east-northeast) that it echoes the contour of the old first-base grandstand."

It is located on 17 acres of the former Miami Orange Bowl site in Little Havana, about 2 miles west of Downtown. Construction was completed in March 2012, in time for the 2012 season.
  The stadium is designed in a neomodern form of baseball architecture. Marlins Park was also LEED certified as the greenest MLB park in 2012. The building is the sixth MLB stadium to have a retractable roof. With a seating capacity of 37,442, it is the third-smallest stadium in Major League Baseball by official capacity, and the smallest by actual capacity.
  There is wide consensus among sports fans that a retractable-roof stadium is a must for professional baseball to be viable in Miami due to both the area's blistering summer heat and frequent rain.
  The facility hosted a second-round pool of the 2013 World Baseball Classic and will host the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game."
